Several thousand temporary files are generated in the process and stored in directory `scratch/`. They correspond to the estimated effects across bootstrap samples, skewness estimates, etc. They are not versioned in this repository for being too many or too big, but ZIP archives are available from the [releases page](https://github.com/julian-urbano/ictir2021-metric/releases/tag/scratch).

- `01-emm1.zip` contains all estimated marginal means across copulas, margins and sample sizes.
- `02-skew.zip` contains all estimates of skewness in the TREC data and simulated data.
- `03-emm2.zip` contains all estimated marginal means across skewness levels.
